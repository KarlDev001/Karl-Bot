# Karl Bot

This repository is meant to show my skills to all the people I work for.

## How to set up

To set up the bot I made it as simple as possible. I now created a [config.json](config.json) file where you can put the
needed things to edit.

Here is an explanation of what everything is:

| Variable                  | What it is                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| YOUR_BOT_PREFIX_HERE      | The prefix you want to use for normal commands                        |
| YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE       | The token of your bot                                                 |
